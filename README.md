# Asplode

*Drop-in exception-based error handling for PHP.*

## Installation

Asplode requires PHP 5.3 or later.

### With [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)

* Add 'eloquent/asplode' to the project's composer.json dependencies
* Run `php composer.phar install`

### Bare installation

* Clone from GitHub: `git clone git://github.com/eloquent/asplode.git`
* Use a [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md) compatible autoloader (namespace 'Eloquent' in the 'src' directory)

## Usage

Asplode can be installed in a single line:

```php
<?php

\Eloquent\Asplode\Asplode::instance()->install();
```

## What does it do?

Asplode is very simple library that sets up an [error handler](http://php.net/set_error_handler)
to throw [ErrorException](http://php.net/ErrorException) exceptions instead of
using the default PHP error handler.

## How will it affect existing code?

The [error_reporting](http://php.net/error_reporting) setting will no longer
have any effect. Any error of any severity will throw an exception.

Any code that previously raised a PHP notice, warning, or error will instead
throw an exception. Code that has been written to handle the old PHP-style errors will most likely
need to be re-written.

As an example, this type of logic:

```php
<?php

$fp = fopen('/path/to/foo', 'r');

if ($fp === false)
{
  // handle error opening file
}
```

would need to be replaced with something like:

```php
<?php

try
{
  $fp = fopen('/path/to/foo', 'r');
}
catch (ErrorException $e)
{
  // handle error opening file
}
```

## Why use Asplode?

Exceptions offer a much more consistent way to handle errors. In modern PHP
development it is generally considered best-practice to use an exception rather
than a legacy-style error.

Asplode offers a hassle-free way to improve the error handling in a PHP
project. It also provides a consistent error handling implementation across
any project or library it's used in, allowing for easier integration.

## Code quality

Asplode strives to attain a high level of quality. A full test suite is
available, and code coverage is closely monitored. All of the above code
examples are also tested.
