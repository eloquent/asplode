## Tests and API documentation

This project uses [Archer] for testing, and API documentation generation:

- Run the tests with `vendor/bin/archer t path/to/tests`, or simply
  `vendor/bin/archer` to run the entire suite.
- Generate a coverage report with `vendor/bin/archer c path/to/tests`, or simply
  `vendor/bin/archer c` to generate coverage for the entire suite. Add `-o` to
  open the report in your browser.
- Generate API documentation with `vendor/bin/archer d`. Serve with
  `php -S localhost:8000 -t artifacts/documentation/api/`, and open your browser
  to [http://localhost:8000/].

For more detailed usage, see the [Archer documentation].
